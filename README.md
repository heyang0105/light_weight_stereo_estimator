This is a personal project gives an experiment for real-time mapping using the stereo camera.

I barely based on ROS to test it in real-time through the zed-wrapper.
The core part is actually independent.

# HOW TO INSTALL IT
1. ZED WRAPPER
2. make project workspace
3. cd src; git clone 
4. . compile_lib.sh; cd ..
5. catkin_make -j4;
